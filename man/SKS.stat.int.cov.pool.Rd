\usage{
SKS.stat.int.cov.pool(Y, Z, W, X)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Observed outcome vector}

\item{Z}{Treatment assigment vector}

\item{W}{Additional pre-treatment covariates to interact with T to define linear model of treatment effects.}

\item{X}{Additional pre-treatment covariates to adjust for in estimation, but not to interact with treatment. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
The value of the test.
}
\description{
Shifted kolmogorov-smirnov statistic with a linear treatment
effect model defined by W
}
\details{
This will attempt to remove any systematic variation corresponding
to W and then return a SKS statistic on the residuals to measure
any variation "left over".

X are _additional_ covariates to adjust for beyond those involved
in treatment effect model.  It will automatically adjust for W as
well.  Do not put a covariate in for both X and W.

This is the test statistic used in Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2016), JRSS-B.
