Description: Implements methods developed by Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2016)
    ''Randomization Inference for Treatment Effect Variation'',
    and Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2018) ''Decomposing Treatment Effect Variation''
    for testing whether there is unexplained variation in treatment effects across observations.
    The package includes wrapper functions implementing the proposed methods, as well
    as helper functions for analyzing and visualizing the results of the test.
