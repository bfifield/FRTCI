#' Implementation of the FRT CI Method of Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2016, JRSS-B) and the
#' systematic estimation methods of Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2018, JASA)
#'
#' This package implements methods developed by Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2016)
#' ''Randomization Inference for Treatment Effect Variation'', for validly testing
#' whether there is unexplained variation in treatment effects across observations.
#' The package also implements methods introduced in Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2018)
#' ''Decomposing Treatment Effect Variation'', for measuring the degree of treatment
#' effect heterogeneity explained by covariates. The package includes wrapper functions
#' implementing the proposed methods, as well as helper functions for analyzing and
#' visualizing the results of the tests.
